  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone the entire repo using HTTPS:
   ```git clone https://github.com/eugen-schaefer/Tetris.git```
2. Make a build directory at the top level of the cloned repo: mkdir build && cd build
3. Compile: cmake .. && make
4. Run the resulting executable from the build folder: ./src/TetrisApp

## How to execute tests
You can run all tests by executing `./test/run_tests.sh` from the repository root.
You can also execute individual tests:
1. Follow the build instruction above
2. From the build folder execute ./test/<testname> where <testname> is the name of the desired test e.g. ./test/TetrominoTest.
